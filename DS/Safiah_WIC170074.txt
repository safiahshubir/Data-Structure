My name is Safiah Binti Shubir Ulwi with matrix number, WIC170074. I am
majoring in Computer System and Network. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this
subject. This is because most of my seniors said that Data Structure is a killer subject.
I acquired B- for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get B for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will try to be more hardworking than last semester. Wish me luck!!!
